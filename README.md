# Planted Word App

This app was created to help users learn the Bible and commit it to memory. You can manually add verses to learn or select from different categories. The app is themed on gardening, so you select a seed (verse) and grow (learn) it by watering (reciting) it. 

### 1. Select Seed

Select a seed from a category or from a specific book (seed vault). Once a seed is selected, click on the button to grow the seed, which will add it as a sprout to be watered. 

#### 1a. Category

#### 1b. Seed Vault

### 2. Water Plant

Once seeds are selected they will be moved in the water tab to be grown. When watered, they will eventually grow into the next stage of the plant's lifecycle (sprout -> seedling -> sapling -> tree). You can select the option to learn the verse, which will guide you by removing words that must be filled in. You can also remove a plant in the watering stage. The last button is modify, and that's just in case some weird issue exists with the verse so it can be modified.

#### 2a. Water Sapling

### 3. Tree

A tree is a well-established verse that can be harvested (evaluated).
